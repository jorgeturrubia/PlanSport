# AgentOS Project Knowledge Base

This directory, `.agent-os/`, serves as the central nervous system for the SmartAgentOS development assistant. It contains all the necessary knowledge, standards, and instructions for the agent to understand and work on this project autonomously.

Treat this directory as the **single source of truth** for the project's architecture, goals, and development process.

## Directory Structure

Here is a breakdown of the key directories and their purpose:

- **/commands**: Contains high-level command definitions that can be executed by the agent. These are user-facing tasks.

- **/doc**: Holds detailed product documentation and formal specifications. This is where the official "what" and "why" of the product features are stored.

- **/instructions**: Core workflows and step-by-step plans for the agent. These are YAML files that define how the agent should perform complex tasks like creating a new feature (`create-spec.yaml`) or executing a development task (`execute-task.yaml`).

- **/product**: High-level product definition documents, including the project's mission (`mission.md`), roadmap (`roadmap.md`), and technology stack (`tech-stack.md`).

- **/specs**: Contains detailed technical specifications for each feature or task. These are generated by the agent based on product requirements and serve as the blueprint for implementation. Each spec is located in a dated folder.

- **/standards**: Defines the coding standards, style guides, and best practices for the project. The agent is required to adhere to these rules to ensure consistency and quality in the codebase. This includes frontend (Angular, Tailwind) and backend (.NET) conventions.

## How It Works

1.  **Mission**: The agent starts with the high-level goal defined in `/product/mission.md`.
2.  **Planning**: It consults the `/instructions` to break down a request into a series of steps.
3.  **Specification**: It creates a detailed plan in the `/specs` directory.
4.  **Execution**: It follows the plan, using the tools and adhering to the `/standards`.
5.  **Documentation**: All decisions and outcomes are recorded, enriching this knowledge base.

By maintaining this directory, we ensure that both human developers and the AI agent have a shared, consistent understanding of the project.
