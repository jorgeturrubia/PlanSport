# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-19-dashboard-ux-refactoring/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture Enhancements

- **Enhanced Dashboard Layout Component** - Refactor `dashboard-layout.component.ts` to implement CSS Grid with improved responsive breakpoints and better semantic HTML structure
- **Interactive Statistics Card Component** - Create new reusable `StatisticsCardComponent` with hover states, click interactions, and animated progress indicators using CSS transforms and transitions
- **Sport Icon Component** - Develop `SportIconComponent` wrapper to handle sport-specific iconography with dynamic sizing, color theming, and state management (active, inactive, hover)
- **Quick Action Hub Component** - Redesign quick action buttons with contextual state management and enhanced visual feedback using Angular Signals
- **Enhanced Sidebar Navigation** - Upgrade sidebar with floating design using CSS backdrop-filter, glassmorphism effects, and smooth state transitions

### Styling and Design System

- **Tailwind CSS Custom Utilities** - Extend Tailwind configuration with sport-specific color palette utilities, custom spacing scales, and animation classes
- **CSS Grid Layout Implementation** - Replace current flexbox layouts with CSS Grid for better content organization and responsive behavior
- **Animation System** - Implement CSS-based micro-interactions using Tailwind's animation utilities and custom keyframe definitions
- **Color Theme System** - Extend existing theme service to support sport-specific color schemes while maintaining accessibility standards
- **Typography Enhancement** - Implement improved font hierarchy using Tailwind's typography utilities with better contrast ratios

### State Management and Interactions

- **Signal-Based UI State** - Implement Angular Signals for managing UI states (sidebar collapse, card interactions, theme preferences)
- **Hover and Focus States** - Add comprehensive hover, focus, and active states for all interactive elements with proper accessibility support
- **Mobile Touch Interactions** - Implement touch-friendly interactions with appropriate touch targets (minimum 44px) and touch feedback
- **Loading and Transition States** - Add loading states for data-driven components with skeleton loading patterns
- **Error State Handling** - Implement graceful error states for dashboard components with retry mechanisms

### Performance Optimizations

- **CSS Optimization** - Utilize Tailwind's purge functionality to minimize CSS bundle size and implement critical CSS loading
- **Component Lazy Loading** - Ensure all dashboard components support Angular's lazy loading with proper change detection optimization
- **Animation Performance** - Use CSS transforms and opacity for animations to leverage GPU acceleration and maintain 60fps
- **Image and Icon Optimization** - Implement proper icon caching and SVG optimization for sport-specific iconography
- **Bundle Size Management** - Monitor component bundle impact and implement dynamic imports where beneficial

### Responsive Design Implementation

- **Mobile-First Approach** - Implement all components starting from mobile breakpoint (320px) with progressive enhancement
- **Breakpoint Strategy** - Utilize Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl) for consistent responsive behavior
- **Touch Target Optimization** - Ensure all interactive elements meet accessibility guidelines for touch target sizes
- **Content Prioritization** - Implement content hiding/showing strategies based on screen real estate
- **Orientation Handling** - Optimize layouts for both portrait and landscape orientations on mobile devices

### Accessibility Enhancements

- **ARIA Implementation** - Add proper ARIA labels, roles, and states for all interactive dashboard components
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
- **Color Contrast Compliance** - Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast ratios
- **Screen Reader Support** - Add descriptive text and announcements for dynamic content changes
- **Motion Preferences** - Respect user's prefers-reduced-motion settings for animations and transitions

### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browser Support** - Target evergreen browsers with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and modern JavaScript features
- **Fallback Strategies** - Implement graceful degradation for older browsers while maintaining core functionality
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Ensure basic functionality works without JavaScript and enhanced features activate progressively
