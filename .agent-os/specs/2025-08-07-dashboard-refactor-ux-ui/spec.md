# Spec: Dashboard Refactor UX/UI

**Date:** 2025-08-07
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the functional requirements for refactoring the main application dashboard. The primary goal is to address critical usability issues, improve the user interface (UI) for a more professional and elegant look, and enhance the overall user experience (UX). The focus is on fixing the navigation bar's aesthetic and the sidebar's broken functionality.

## 2. User Stories

### US-1: Professional Navigation Bar
- **As a:** Coach
- **I want to:** see a professional and clean navigation bar with a consistent and intuitive set of icons
- **So that:** I can easily understand the purpose of each navigation item and perceive the application as a high-quality, professional tool.

### US-2: Functional Sidebar Toggle
- **As a:** User
- **I want to:** use a sidebar toggle button that remains visible and functional whether the sidebar is open or closed
- **So that:** I can fluidly expand and collapse the navigation to maximize my screen real estate without losing control.

## 3. Spec Scope

### In Scope
1.  **Navbar Icon Redesign:** Replace the current "childish" multi-colored icons with a professional, monochrome, and consistent icon set. The new icons must align with the style of the application (e.g., using Lucide Icons or Material Icons as defined in the tech stack).
2.  **Fix Sidebar Toggle Mechanism:** Re-implement the sidebar toggle button so that it is always accessible. When the sidebar is collapsed, a smaller, icon-only version of the toggle should remain visible.
3.  **Improve Sidebar UX:** Ensure the expand/collapse animation is smooth and the main content area resizes correctly without layout shifts.

### Out of Scope
- Adding new pages or sections to the navigation.
- A complete overhaul of the application's color theme (changes will be limited to icons and navigation components).
- Modifying backend functionality.
- Changing the informational content displayed on the dashboard.

## 4. Expected Deliverable
1. A redesigned application navbar featuring a professional and consistent icon set.
2. A fully functional sidebar where the toggle control is persistent and intuitive.
3. Improved layout stability and smoother transitions when interacting with the sidebar.
