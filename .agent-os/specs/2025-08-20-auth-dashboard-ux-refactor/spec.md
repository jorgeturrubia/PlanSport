# Authentication & Dashboard UX Refactoring Specification

## Overview
Refactor the authentication pages and dashboard components to improve user experience through enhanced navigation flow, modern design system implementation, and improved accessibility standards.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Enhanced Authentication Flow
As a user, I want a streamlined authentication experience where I can easily navigate between login, registration, and password reset flows with clear visual feedback and accessibility features, so that I can access the platform efficiently regardless of my abilities.

**Workflow:**
1. User visits auth page and sees intuitive login/register options
2. Forms provide real-time validation feedback with clear error messaging
3. Password reset flow is easily accessible and provides clear instructions
4. All auth components follow accessibility best practices (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
5. Success states provide clear next steps

### Story 2: Improved Dashboard Navigation
As a authenticated user, I want an intuitive dashboard with improved navigation flow and modern UI components so that I can efficiently access all platform features and manage my teams and profile settings.

**Workflow:**
1. User enters dashboard and sees clean, organized layout with clear navigation
2. Sidebar provides logical grouping of features with visual indicators
3. Header contains user menu with easy access to profile and settings
4. Navigation state is preserved and provides clear visual feedback
5. All dashboard areas are accessible via keyboard and screen readers

### Story 3: Consistent Design System Implementation
As a user, I want a consistent visual experience across authentication and dashboard areas that follows modern design principles and provides excellent usability on all devices.

**Workflow:**
1. User experiences consistent color schemes, typography, and component styling
2. Hero Icons are used consistently for visual communication
3. Responsive design works seamlessly across devices
4. Theme support (if applicable) provides consistent experience
5. Loading states and transitions are smooth and informative
